"""
Design a locker system like Amazon Locker where delivery drivers can deposit packages and customers can pick them up using a code.

1. primary capabilities
2. error handling
3. scope boundaries

Primary capabilities:

- Are there different sized compartments? 
- How does the customer get their code? Do we need to send an SMS or email?

Error handling:

- Can one customer have multiple packages in the system at once? Are access tokens unique per package?
- How long do the codes last? What happens to a package if it's never picked up?
- What if all compartments of a given size are full when a driver tries to deposit?

Scope boundaries:

- What's in scope for this system? Are we modeling the whole delivery flow, or just the piece from when the driver arrives at the locker until the customer picks up?


Requirements:
1. Carrier deposits a package by specifying size (small, medium, large)
   - System assigns an available compartment of matching size
   - Opens compartment and returns access token, or error if no space
2. Upon successful deposit, an access token is generated and returned
   - One access token per package
3. entities.User retrieves package by entering access token
   - System validates code and opens compartment
   - Throws specific error if code is invalid or expired
4. Access tokens expire after 7 days
   - Expired codes are rejected if used for pickup
   - Package remains in compartment until staff removes it
5. Staff can open all expired compartments to manually handle packages
   - System opens all compartments with expired tokens
   - Staff physically removes packages and returns them to sender

Out of scope:
- How the package gets to the locker (delivery logistics)
- How the access token reaches the customer (SMS/email notification)

Entities:
- Compartments
- Locker
- AccessToken
